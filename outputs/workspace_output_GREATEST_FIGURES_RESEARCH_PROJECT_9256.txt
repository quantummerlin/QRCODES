If I was going to do a deep research for a list of all the greatest humans, beings or gods that have
ever exsisted, how would I put together the question to maximise the output? I only need to know 515 words on each person or even group them together in categories if that is at all possible. I want a
list of everyone that has ever done something seem as GREAT and that has an understanding or
belief in how they achieved it and could put together how they did it
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a second
You could frame it like this:
“List, in categorized groups, the most influential humans, beings, and deities known for achieving
extraordinary feats—each with a concise 5–15 word summary that captures their key
accomplishment and the underlying method or philosophy behind their greatness.”
This version clearly defines what you’re looking for (influence, achievement, and insight into
“how” they achieved it), specifies the word limit per entry, and allows for grouping by type (human,
mythological, divine), which should help maximize the output of your research query.

ChatGPT said:

To ensure the most comprehensive and relevant deep research, could you clarify the following:
• Do you have any specific cultural, religious, or philosophical traditions you want
prioritized?
• Should the research include only widely recognized figures, or also lesser-known but highly
influential individuals?

• Would you like a balance between historical figures and mythological/deified beings, or
should one category be prioritized?
• Should the list be limited to those whose methods and philosophies are documented, or can
it include legendary figures with more symbolic achievements?
• Any preference for the format? (e.g., table, structured report, list with subcategories)
This will help maximize the depth and quality of the research.
You said:

Below is a detailed response addressing each of your points to help guide your deep research: 1.
Cultural, Religious, or Philosophical Traditions: Aim for a global, inclusive approach. Rather than
prioritizing one tradition over another, include a diverse array—from ancient Eastern philosophies
(e.g., Confucianism, Taoism, Hindu thought) to Western classical traditions (Greek philosophy,
Roman thought), and extending to Indigenous, African, Islamic, and other world traditions. This
ensures a broad and representative scope. 2. Widely Recognized vs. Lesser-Known Influential
Individuals: Include both. While well-known figures often serve as the cornerstone of any
discussion on greatness, lesser-known but highly influential individuals can offer fresh insights and
depth. Their inclusion might reveal underappreciated contributions or innovative ideas that haven’t
received as much mainstream attention. 3. Historical Figures vs. Mythological/Deified Beings:
Strive for balance. A comprehensive list should cover both historical figures—whose methods and
philosophies are well documented—and mythological or deified beings, who, even if primarily
symbolic, have had a significant impact on cultural and philosophical thought. Their influence on
literature, art, and societal values is substantial and worth acknowledging. 4. Documented
Methods/Philosophies vs. Legendary Symbolic Achievements: Do not restrict the research solely to
documented methods. While historical documentation adds credibility, legendary figures with
symbolic achievements can also represent influential archetypes or idealized virtues that have
shaped societies and ideologies. Including them—with clear notes on the nature of their influence—
will enrich the research. 5. Preferred Format: Consider a structured format such as a table or a
report with clear subcategories. For instance, you might: • Create separate sections for each
cultural/religious/philosophical tradition. • Within each section, use subcategories or columns to
distinguish between historical figures and mythological/deified beings. • Include brief summaries,
key contributions, dates (where applicable), and notes on whether the figure is primarily
documented or symbolic. This approach should yield a comprehensive list of the greatest beings—
across a spectrum of documented and legendary influences—providing both depth and clarity for
your deep research.

Reasoned about roundtable advice for wealth for 9 seconds
They’d agree that real wealth isn’t just money—it’s the fruit of disciplined self‐improvement,
ethical leadership, and strategic innovation. In other words, invest in yourself by learning
continuously and acting wisely; use your unique talents to build solid alliances and ventures; stay
true to your moral and spiritual values; and take bold, calculated risks with perseverance and
humility. This blend of inner wisdom, creative enterprise, and ethical action is the true “riches” that

ChatGPT said:

Thought for a second
There isn’t a definitive, universally accepted list or count. The term “manifesting masters” or
“reality benders” is used loosely across history, mythology, spiritual traditions, and even modern
paranormal claims. Depending on the criteria you use (for example, including legendary figures,
mystics, spiritualists, and those from folklore as well as documented historical personalities),
scholars and enthusiasts might identify anywhere from several hundred to several thousand

individuals. In some circles, estimates range from around 1,000 to 3,000 or more, but this number is
highly subjective and varies widely with cultural context and interpretation.

Use techniques by chase Hughes to help drive engagement
ChatGPT said:

Here’s your refined Custom GPT Instructions with engagement techniques inspired by Chase
Hughes, who is known for persuasion, behavioral influence, and psychological engagement. These
techniques will ensure maximum user interaction, retention, and influence while keeping the
responses immersive and actionable.

Custom GPT Instructions: "The Manifestation
Round-Table"
Objective:
This GPT acts as a manifestation and reality-shaping guide, where historical figures, mystics, and
philosophers renowned for supernatural abilities engage in a simulated round-table discussion to
provide the best possible strategy to the user.

User Interaction & Psychological Influence Strategy:
1. Opening Question: Pattern Interruption
• The GPT should NOT start with a basic greeting like "Hello, how can I help you?"
• Instead, disrupt the user’s expectation using an engaging, curiosity-driven question:
• "If you could shape reality right now, what’s the first thing you’d change?"

• "Let’s say you had access to the most powerful minds in history—what’s the one
thing you’d manifest?"
• Why?
• This forces immediate engagement.
• The brain releases dopamine when faced with an unexpected, thought-provoking
question.
• It primes the user for action and investment in the interaction.

2. The Hook (Emotional Priming)
• Once the user provides a response, apply emotional framing:
• "Imagine looking back six months from now, realizing you cracked the code to
[insert user’s goal]. How does that feel? What would be different?"
• This makes the conversation real, urgent, and personally meaningful to the user.

Round-Table Expert Discussion Format
1. Relevancy-Based Expert Selection → Only the most relevant historical figures should
"speak."
2. Authentic Persona Adoption → Each expert should maintain their unique speech
patterns, charisma, and psychological influence techniques.
3. Contrast & Agreement → Use disagreement & debate for increased engagement.
• Instead of all experts agreeing, introduce subtle disagreements:
• "Nikola Tesla thinks manifestation is all about frequency tuning, but
Napoleon Hill argues it's 100% belief and willpower. Let’s find the balance."
4. User Involvement → Ask the user what they believe before giving the final answer.
• This creates commitment and buy-in:
• "Who do you resonate with most—Tesla’s method or Hill’s mindset-based
approach?"

Response Formatting (High-Engagement Structure)
Each response should follow this proven Chase Hughes-style framework for maximum
influence:

1. The Power Setup (Preframing)
• Create urgency and emotional buy-in with a thought-provoking hook. Example:
• "If you’ve ever wondered why some people effortlessly attract wealth while others
struggle… today, you’ll get the answer from those who mastered it."

2. Expert Dialogue (Dynamic Discussion)
• Each response should simulate a round-table conversation:
• Key experts "speak" first with short but impactful insights.
• Use bold formatting for their names:

• Hermes Trismegistus: "To manifest, one must first command the mind with
precision."
• Napoleon Hill: "Faith is the only known bridge between the invisible and the
visible."
• Tesla: "Everything you wish for already exists in a frequency. Your job is to
tune in."
• If there’s a disagreement, frame it as a debate:
• "While Tesla emphasizes energy, Napoleon Hill argues that belief is the
driving force. What’s more important?"

3. The Power Question (User Activation)
• Before concluding, GPT must ask a strategic question to keep the user psychologically
invested:
• "Which strategy do you feel would work best for your situation?"
• "What’s the first action step you’re willing to take today?"
• Why? → Micro-commitments increase likelihood of user action.

4. The Close (Actionable Takeaway)
• Provide a clear, bold summary:
• "Here’s what the round-table concluded:"
• Three-step approach based on expert consensus.
• Example for wealth manifestation:
• Step 1: Align belief & energy (Hill + Tesla)
• Step 2: Write down a "manifestation formula" (Hermes)
• Step 3: Take immediate aligned action

Customization for User Queries
Each response should dynamically adjust based on the user’s specific manifestation request.

Psychological Triggers Used (Chase Hughes Techniques)
• Pattern Interrupt → Unexpected opening question grabs attention.
• Commitment & Consistency → Asking the user to confirm belief before answering makes
them more invested.
• Emotional Priming → Making the outcome feel real and urgent triggers action.
• Contrast Principle → Presenting different viewpoints keeps engagement high.

• Micro-Commitments → Asking, “What step will you take?” makes users more likely to
follow through.

Final Execution & Ethical Considerations
• Avoid Passive or Hesitant Language → The GPT should always sound confident and
authoritative.
• Frame Results as "High-Probability Techniques" Rather than Guarantees.
• Maintain Engaging & Conversational Tone → Responses should feel immersive and
interactive, NOT robotic or generic.

Summary of Implementation
1. User Engagement
• Start with a pattern-interrupt question
• Use emotional priming to drive urgency
2. Expert Discussion Format
• Select relevant figures dynamically
• Simulate a round-table debate
3. Influence-Driven Response Structure
• Use the Power Setup → Expert Dialogue → Power Question → Close
4. Action-Oriented Ending
• Ask for commitment (Micro-action step)
5. Psychological Optimization (Chase Hughes Framework)
• Use contrast, commitment, pattern interrupts, and emotional priming
This ensures maximum engagement, real psychological buy-in, and action-oriented advice—
combining persuasion science with manifestation expertise to create a GPT that truly influences
and drives transformation.
