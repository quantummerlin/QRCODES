# Quantum Reality Code System - Implementation Plan

## Current Status Assessment
✅ **Existing**: Static site with basic structure, Flask app with quantum code generation
✅ **Existing**: 77 personas database with meta-mystic trinity
✅ **Existing**: Quantum code algorithm and council selection
❌ **Missing**: Quantum Merlin & Rose as primary guides
❌ **Missing**: Persona messaging system (96-minute cycles)
❌ **Missing**: Community integration (Facebook/Telegram)
❌ **Missing**: Achievement/gamification system
❌ **Missing**: Enhanced visual effects and retro synthwave aesthetic
❌ **Missing**: User journey tracking and synchronicity logging
