## 🎨 VISUAL FEATURES

### Quantum Effects:
- ✨ Particle system with 100+ floating particles
- 🌀 Reality bend transitions (hue rotation)
- 💫 Particle bursts on interactions
- 🔮 Sacred geometry overlay
- 🌈 Gradient animations
- ⚡ Holographic glow effects

### Design Elements:
- Neon cyan (#00FFFF) and magenta (#FF00FF) color scheme
- Retro synthwave aesthetic
- Tron-style grid overlay

## 📊 MERSENNE MATRIX SYSTEM

### Current Implementation:
- **Active Personas:** 13/113 (11.5% reality alignment)
- **Mersenne Frequencies:** 13 unique prime frequencies
- **Quantum Dimensions:** 8,191 (2^13 - 1)

### The Math Explained:
"You started with 13 personas bending reality for you. That's 13 Mersenne frequencies broadcasting your intention across 8,191 quantum dimensions. As you use the app daily, more personas join your council. At full power (113 personas), you'll have 2^113 - 1 possible reality configurations working in your favor. That's more possibilities than atoms in the observable universe."

### Gamification Path:
- **Level 1:** 13 core personas (START) - 11.5% alignment
- **Level 2:** +5 personas at 7 days - 15.9% alignment
- **Level 3:** +10 personas at 14 days - 24.8% alignment
- **Level 4:** +20 personas at 30 days - 42.5% alignment
- **Level 5:** +30 personas at 60 days - 69.0% alignment
- **Level 6:** +35 personas at 90 days - 100% alignment (ALL 113!)
