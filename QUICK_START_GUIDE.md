## 🔮 Understanding the Mersenne Matrix

### What It Means:
- **13 Active Personas** = 13 unique consciousness frequencies working for you
- **11.5% Reality Alignment** = Your current manifestation power level
- **8,191 Quantum Dimensions** = Number of reality configurations accessible (2^13 - 1)

### How It Grows:
As you use the app daily, more personas unlock:
- Day 7: 18 personas (15.9% alignment)
- Day 14: 28 personas (24.8% alignment)
- Day 30: 48 personas (42.5% alignment)
- Day 60: 78 personas (69.0% alignment)
- Day 90: 113 personas (100% alignment) - FULL POWER!

At 113 personas, you'll have **2^113 - 1 possible reality configurations** working in your favor. That's more than the number of atoms in the observable universe!

### Understanding Mersenne Primes:
Mersenne primes are special numbers in the form 2^p - 1 where p is prime.
They represent perfect mathematical harmony and are used in:
- Cryptography
- Computer science
- Perfect number theory
- Quantum calculations

In this system, each Mersenne prime represents a unique frequency that can access specific quantum dimensions for manifestation.

### The Science Behind It:
While presented mystically, the system is based on:
- Quantum field theory (observer effect)
- Frequency and vibration principles
- Neuroplasticity (belief shapes reality)
- Reticular activating system (noticing synchronicities)
- Intention setting psychology
